# linkin

A minimal Clojure web crawling library built atop
[http-kit](http://http-kit.org) for asynchronicity & concurrency, and
[Jsoup](http://jsoup.org) for HTML parsing.

("linkin" from Linkin Park's
["Crawling"](http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/linkinpark/crawling.html),
and because links)


## Usage
Right now it's not on [clojars](http://clojars.org) yet, so you'll
need to build and install it locally using a method of your own choosing
([lein-localrepo](https://github.com/kumarshantanu/lein-localrepo)
is a good choice)

Then include the following dependency in your project.clj:
```clojure
[linkin "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"]
```

Then:
```clojure
(require 'linkin.core)
(linkin.core/crawl "http://example.com" linkin.core/simple-body-parser)
```

## Todo
+ Respect robots.txt
+ Control of max depth
+ Ability to spider across domains
+ Filtering by content type
+ Stats while running
+ Namespace state by run (currently shares state so can't run multiple instances alongside)
+ Look at using a crawl queue instead of the link-agent
